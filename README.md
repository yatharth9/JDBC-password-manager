# JDBC-password-manager
A Simple password manager made in Java using JDBC to connect it to MYSQL Database

### This project was my team's submission for a semester end project in Java. 

#### This utilizes a Prebuilt Mysql Database with the required schema, although I think I can add the SQL queries used in creating the tables if needed. 

*Requires Mysql Connector for Java*
